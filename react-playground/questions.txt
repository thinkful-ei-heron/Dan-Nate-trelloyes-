1. What situations would be good to use context?
  Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible 
  by many components at different nesting levels. 

2. If you need to pass a prop down 1 or 2 levels, is context necessary?
  It is no necessary and it should be used sparingly 
  because it makes component reuse more difficult.

3. Can you pass a component instance as a prop to avoid the need for context?
  Yes. The benefit to passing in a component is that you will not 
  be passing in a new function to be rendered each time.

4. Can you write your own components that accept render props?
  Yes. It is helpful if two or more context values are often used together.
